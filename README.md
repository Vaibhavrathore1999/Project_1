This is a Assignment Problem 
Assignment:
The objective is to implement a basic image segmentation algorithm using convolutional neural networks (CNN). You can use any framework of your choice (PyTorch, TensorFlow, sci-kit learn etc):

Dataset Preparation: Create a small synthetic dataset containing images with simple shapes on a contrasting background
Masks: Generate corresponding binary masks for each images, where the shapes are segmented
Model: Design a simple CNN architecture or use the smaller version of pre-built models for image segmentation
I/O: The input should be an RGB image and the output a binary mask indicating the segmented region
Training: Aim for a brief iteration on the training set (10-15 epochs)
Inference: Report key training metrics, perform segmentations using the model on a few images from the validation set and document your findings
